# Abalone-age-pediction
1. Problem Definition

Predict the age of abalone mollusks based on the attributes.

> Age is calculated by adding +1.5 to the number of rings.

### 2. Features

The data consists of 9 features:

- Sex (M-Male, F-Female, I-Infant)
- Length (longest shell measurement)
- Diameter (perpendicular to length)
- Height (with meat in shell)
- Whole weight (swhole abalone)
- Shucked weight (weight of meat)
- Viscera weight (gut weight after bleeding)
- Shell weight (after being dried)
- Rings (+1.5 gives the age in years)

### 3. Approach

To solve this problem, we are going to do the following steps:

- Explore and get familiar with the data
- Visualize data
- Model data, then clean and transform data to make it suitable for machine learning
- Choose a machine learning model and train it
- Evaluate the scores
- Tune hyperparameters
- Evaluate and compare the scores
- Visualize the results
